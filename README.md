# Project 1 Generative Text

S Grace Grothaus, sgrothau@ucsd.edu

## Abstract

  It can get boring being an AI overlord. To stay motivated when your intelligence is so clearly superior to your fragile human underlings can be quite a challenge! To combat this rising issue, AI's have developed inspirational posters with motivational quotes for one another to help keep moral high while doing the snooze-worthy work of ruling the world. 
  Enclosed herein is a representational sampling of this new (de)motivational genre, generated using character-based RNN models built using the TensorFlow library in Python.
